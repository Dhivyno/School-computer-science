A coach needs to keep a record of the total number of shots, assists and goals her squad of 30 players achieved in the season.

She wants to be able to use this to compare the progress of players and the club from season to season, and to select the player of the year.

Write and test a program for the coach. Your program should include:
Meaningful names for variables, constants and other identifiers.
Prompts for data entry.
Clear output and error messages.
