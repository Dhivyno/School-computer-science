An auction company has an interactive auction board at their sale rooms, which allows buyers to place bids at any time during the auction. Before the auction starts, the sellers place their items in the sale room with a unique number attached to each item (item number). The following details about each item need to be set up on the interactive auction board system: item number, number of bids, description and reserve price. The number of bids is initially set to zero.
					
During the auction, buyers can look at the items in the sale room and then place a bid on the interactive auction board at the sale room. Each buyer is given a unique number for identification (buyer number). All the buyer needs to do is enter their buyer number, the item number and their bid. Their bid must be greater than any existing bids.
					
At the end of the auction, the company checks all the items and marks those that have bids greater than the reserve as sold. Any items sold will incur a fee of 10% of the final bid to be paid to the auction company.
