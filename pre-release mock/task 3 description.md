Customers have complained that sometimes they are being charged too much if they arrive before 16:00 and depart after 16:00. Extend Task 1 to calculate the price before 16:00, then add the evening charge. For example, a customer arriving at 14:45 on a Sunday and parking for five hours was previously charged 10.00 and would now be charged 6.00

To make this task much EASIER. Put the calculation part of your task 1 into its own file and rather than re-enter the data each time. Use ready-made variables.
