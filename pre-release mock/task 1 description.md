A customer inputs the day, the hour of arrival excluding minutes (for example 15:45 would be 15), the number of hours to leave their car, and a frequent parking number if available. If the frequent parking number has an incorrect check digit, then no discount can be applied. The price to park, based on the day, the hour of arrival, the number of hours of parking required and any discount available, is calculated and displayed.
